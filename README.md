# Personal-Driver-s-Test-Program
A Desktop Application for practicing Pennsylvania driverâ€™s permit test questions read from a CSV File (Python).

This is a python program I wrote to help me study for the Pennsylvania driver's permit test using all of the questions found in Pennsylvania Driver's Manual, rather than using the official app that only supports 18 questions as a time. The code reads a csv file containing all of the formatted questions and then displays them sequentially, allowing the user to quiz themselves.
The Pennsylvania Driver's Manual can be located here: https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dmv/driver-services/pennsylvania-drivers-manual.html
